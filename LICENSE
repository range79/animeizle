Hello friend!

I’m sharing this project openly so everyone can see and learn from it.
The source code is here for you to explore and understand as you wish.
But I have a few small requests and boundaries because this project is my passion and effort.

What You Can Do:
- Read the code and try it out on your own computer.
- Use it for personal projects and keep learning.
- If you want to contribute, feel free to send me a pull request.
- If you don’t understand something, just ask me anytime.

But Please Don’t (Without Permission):
- Publish or deploy this project anywhere online.
- Integrate my code or APIs into your own projects.
- Use the APIs without permission.
- Use it for commercial purposes.

---

If You Want to Integrate It Into Your Project:
Write to me and ask for permission, let’s talk!
If I give permission, I’d be really happy if you give me a small credit or mention.
Because being recognized in the software world means a lot to me, and your support is a big strength.

About Fees and Support:
Using the API services may sometimes require a small fee as a way to support the effort I put into this project.
But I’m very flexible and understanding about this.

If your financial situation is not good or your budget is limited, that’s absolutely not a problem.
You can write to me anytime, honestly and openly.
Tell me your needs, your project goals, and your budget.
Together, with mutual understanding and sincerity, we will find the best solution.

What matters most to me is your intention and sincerity. Money is secondary.
I know that sometimes young developers, students, or beginners might have budget problems.
That’s why I never want to put you in a difficult spot.

At the same time, this support request is a tool to keep the project alive and make it better.
If you have the means and you like the project, you can support me with a small contribution.
This way, I can keep improving the project and provide better service to you and other users.

In short:
- Even if your financial situation is tough, don’t hesitate to write to me — I will definitely help.
- If you can afford it, a small support is very valuable and keeps the project running.
- Sincerity and honesty are always my priority.
